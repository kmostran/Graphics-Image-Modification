Press key 1,2,3,...8 to go between the images.

When you initialize an image, all effects are set to default. For example, if you rotated and blured image 1 and then pressed 2, image 2 will dipslay without a blur or rotation.

Scroll up and down to magnify in and out, press r and scroll to rotate the image. Press r again to go back to magnifying and so on.

Click and drag with the right mouse button to move the image around.
I also modified the sepia tone to have more of an old movie look, so it looks good for image 6.

Pressing c repeatedly applies all of the colours.

Pressing u applies the unsharp.

Pressing h applies the horizontal sobel.

Pressing v applies the vertical sobel.

Pressing g repeatedly applies all of the blurs.
