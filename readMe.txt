Press key 1,2,3,...8 to go between the images.

When you initialize an image, all effects are set to default. For example, if you rotated and blured image 1 and then pressed 2, image 2 will dipslay without a blur or rotation.

Scroll up and down to magnify in and out, press r and scroll to rotate the image. Press r again to go back to magnifying and so on.

Click and drag with the right mouse button to move the image around.
I also modified the sepia tone to have more of an old movie look, so it looks good for image 6.

Pressing c repeatedly applies all of the colours.

Pressing u applies the unsharp.

Pressing h applies the horizontal sobel.

Pressing v applies the vertical sobel.

Pressing g repeatedly applies all of the blurs.

And for the question, I don't have the best vision for colours but I believe the third greyscale looks the best as the white and black each seemed more defined. Different combinations exist becasue the intensities are not linearly related (as we found out from the written). Moreover, the cones in our eyes do not have equal quantity of each type.
